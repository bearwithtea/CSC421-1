Creighton University is a place where changemakers connect with like-minded peers and faculty who care deeply about giving students the tools to make our world a better place. As part of Creighton University, the Graduate School is dedicated to helping agents of change further master their area of expertise and thrive in their careers or academic pursuits.

Under the guidance of expert faculty, graduate students at Creighton engage in discussion, research and various immersive learning experiences. Programs across disciplines foster critical and creative thinking and provide ethical perspectives for dealing with an increasingly complex world.

When not working closely with students, Creighton faculty members conduct research to enhance teaching, to contribute to the betterment of society and to discover new knowledge. They model a passion for learning and spirit of magis that is felt by our entire community.

At Creighton, all of this comes together to engage the whole student - mind, body and spirit - in the learning process. This dedication to cura personalis is at the core of a Jesuit education.

Our mission is to produce leaders who have the wisdom, judgment, confidence, compassion, and faith to work for a more just world. To accomplish this mission, we are inspired by Catholic values and a Jesuit educational philosophy.
