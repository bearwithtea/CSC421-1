Create a textual description of the figure below. Be sure to state the business rules (both directions) that are captured by this model (e.g. an employee is assigned to one and only one supervisor):

This figure is seperated into the three different parts of a book's lifespan. It is written by the author, published by one publishing house, and then sold to a customer via a sale. A book is written by one author, published by one publishing house, and then sold to any number of customers. A publishing house can sell many different books. In this case, the customer only purchases one book, but many sales to many different customers can be made.
